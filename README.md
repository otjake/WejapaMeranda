This is a blog site with more than one content creator and a super admin,
User can create an account and create contents of their own and publish 
on the site pages

#Motivation
This was made to fulfill the final test for Wejapa internship project and to test how independent I am now.

#Code style
The system follows a very basic code style,having page contents in the root folder,needed functions, processors and common files(header,footer,sidebar) in the includes folder,
style sheets in a css folder and javascript in a js folder.
